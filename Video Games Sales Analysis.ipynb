    "\n",
    "Video games creation is essentially a software development process. Generally, publishers such as EA Sports, Atari, Rockstar Games etc. fund the game development process. However, for publishers, it is very important to estimate the cost of development of a video game. Most of the commercial games do not generate adequate profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "A video game is an interactive visual story. A new game must provide novelty and must be a product of innovation. Nevertheless, once the companies become financially stable by making sufficient profits, they may expand to develop newer games or sequels to the initial ones such as FIFA, Call of Duty, Age of Empires etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "An average development budget for a multiplatform (PC, PS, Xbox etc.) game is US \\$18 to 28 million, with high-profile games often exceeding US $40 million.\n",
